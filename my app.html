      <p>i would like to create the following apps 
        <li> * the first app i would lik eto create is called Te Whare Tapa Wha this app will be a app made for our youth witch
          will also go with out life talk books. FOR ME I HAVE NOTICED A LOT OF GAPS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH INDUSTRY WHEN IT COMES TO YOUTH KIDS. I THINK THIS APP WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR KIDS THAT SUFFER FROM ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION. AS NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TALKING TO OTHERS ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS SO THIS APP IS A WAY FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE OPENING UP TO STILL GET THE HELP THEY NEED AND THIS APP IS FULLY CONFIDENTIAl. 
 STUDIES SHOW THAT NEW ZEALAND HAS THE HIGHEST SUICIDE RATES IN THE WORLD AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS APP COULD HELP.
THEY ALSO SHOW THAT LAST YEAR NEWZEALAND BROKE THE RECORD OF THE MOST SUICIDES BY 17 PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY EITHER REACHED OUT FOR HELP AND DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY NEEDED OR THEY WERE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT DONT LIKE OPENING UP AND ALL THEY NEEDED WAS A APP LIKE  TE WHARE TAPA WHA. 

          when the users go onto the app it will explane what Te Whare Tapa Wha is and why it is important    
      when the users scroll up it lists examples of each pillar and asks them to apply their knowledge to their own pillars.  They can assess how full each pillar feels for them by choosing 1 for empty or 5 for full.
This made me think of how we can help youth that might be feeling empty in one of their pillars.

          <li> The next app i would like to create is called 10K
            
.</p>ON THE 31/12/19 10,000+ NEW ZEALAND KIDS WENT TO BED KNOWING THEY HAD A PARENT INCARCERATED.  
    STUDIES SHOW THAT IN NZ SUICIDE RATES AMONG NZ YOUTH ARE 4 TIMES HIGHER FOR YOUTH WITH PARENTS IN PRISON DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE CONTACT WITH THEIR PARENT AND THEY FEEL ABANDON. 
    I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A APP THAT HELPS YOUTH CONNECT WITH THEIR PARENT/S WHO MIGHT BE IN JAIL.THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO UPLOAD VIDEOS ,LETTERS AND MESSAGES WHICH WILL BE VIEWED AND RESPONDED TO BY THEIR PARENT.
    THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A WAY FOR THE YOUTH TO CONNECT WITH THEIR PARENTS WHANAU AS THESE RELATIONSHIPS OFTEN FALL APART TO. IT WOULD BE COOL IF IT WAS LIKE A FAMILY FACEBOOK PAGE OR A FAMILY GROUP CHAT WITH ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WOULD BE WHANAU MANBERS
