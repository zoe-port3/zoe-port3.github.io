   <li>In this app you must put your groceries for the week and the shop u would normally go grocery shopping. Let's say u go grocery shopping at countdown and this app will go on the countdown website and find every item calculate how much it will cost and then it will only let u spend that amount of money at the countdown</li>
   <li> there will also me a section on the app where u can put money in a separate category called shopping and in that category there will be like "shoes" or "clothes" or "credit" etc and you can also pick how much money goes into those accounts so that you don't overspend</li>
