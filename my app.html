      <h2>A Pay Restriction App</h2>
      <p>A app that when u get paid it automatically pays your bills and then say on if u get paid on tuesday you will have money for grocries and every week an amount of money of your choice will be put away and you will only be able to acsess it at the end of the year and your bills are always paid on time and you always have money 

       in this app you must put your groceries for the week and if for example on monday you want chocolate and you'r grocries list it doesn't say chocolate you'r card will decline and it will only let you buy stuff you need.
       there will also me a section on the app where u can put money in a seprate category called shopping and in that vategory there will be like "shoes" or "clother" or "credit" etc and you can also pick how much money goes into those accounts so that you dont over spend
